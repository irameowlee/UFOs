# UFOs
##Overview of Project
- To create a table to organize UFO data that is stored in JSON array. 
- To create a table that has the ability to filter data based on certain criteria
- To use Javascript as the primary coding languate
- To customize webpage using bootstrap

##Results
With the provided UFO dataset that was in the form of a JSON array, code was written to create a table on the HTML webpage. Filters were created so that UFO sightings can be searched based on the filter criteria. 

##Summary
A drawback is the fact that the data is not updated because the data is coming from a JSON file. This website would be improved by using up-to-date data by scraping information directly from another site.
